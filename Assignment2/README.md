### Assignment 2: Hill Climbing 
Due: Friday, February 25, 2022


1. Hill-climbing 

   a) Consider a function f(x) = 2 - x2 in the following discrete state-space, where x  [-5, 5], step-size 0.5. Implement the hill-climbing algorithm in python to find the maximum value for the above function. 




   b) Change the step-size to 0.01. Run the hill-climbing algorithm and share your observations. 








2. Random-restart hill-climbing

   a) Consider a function 
g(x) = (0.0051x5) - (0.1367x4) + (1.24x3) - (4.456x2) + (5.66x) - 0.287 in the following discrete state-space, where x  [0, 10], step-size 0.5. Implement the random-restart hill-climbing algorithm for 20 random restarts in python to find the global maximum value for the above function. 




   b) Run the hill-climbing algorithm for the function g(x). Compare and analyze the results of hill-climbing with the random-restart hill-climbing algorithm.
